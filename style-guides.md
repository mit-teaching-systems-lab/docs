# Style guides
This is the style guide for software engineering work in the Teaching Systems Lab.

When possible, we should encode specific rules in a linter or other tooling.  This is for more subjective items that require more judgment and therefore also have more flexibility.  If you have questions, comments or improvements, please share them!  Open a pull request or come talk to @kevinrobinson or anyone else in the lab.
