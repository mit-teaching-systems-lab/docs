# Learning React

Here are some different options for learning about React or React Native.  They're all good, so feel free to explore whatever depending on how you like to learn:

- The [official React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) is good, and my favorite simplest explanation of how break down the steps of building UIs is [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).
- To start hacking on React Native right away, you can use the amazing black magic at [React Native Playground](https://rnplay.org/) to make apps in your browser.  You can edit code and see it in a phone simulator without installing anything, so it's great for first-time hacking.
- There are some good ~5min videos on [React Native](https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals) on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/), which walk through part of the development environment setup too.  This might be a good complement to the [official React Native tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html).
Sometimes people get hung up on all the pieces and tools that people talk about in the React ecosystem, so these tutorials should avoid most of that.  If you run into this noise when Googling, this is a great guide about [how to tackle the React ecosystem](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto), and which order to learn things in.  More recently, there's the awesome [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project that aims to wrap all that up into a single project and single command, so I'd recommended that if you just want to get to making things.
- And if you are into good ol' fashioned books, there's an awesome SF tweep who wrote an actual book with paper and everything called [Learning React Native](https://twitter.com/brindelle/status/688081020923572225).
- This [React FAQ](https://github.com/timarney/react-faq) is also great.
